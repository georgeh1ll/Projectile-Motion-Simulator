# Projectile-Motion-Simulator

This is a Python application that simulates projectile motion and plots a graph of the trajectory of a particle acting under gravity.

## Features

- Simulate projectile motion with user-defined initial velocity and launch angle.
- Plot the trajectory of the projectile in a customizable graph.
- Set custom x and y limits for the graph.

### Using the Windows Executable (`.exe`) Version:

1. **Download the Executable:**
   - Go to the [GitHub releases](https://github.com/georgeh1ll/Projectile-Motion-Simulator/releases) page.
   - Find the latest release and locate the Windows executable file (e.g., `projectile_motion_simulator.exe`).
   - Click on the file to download it.

2. **Run the Executable:**
   - Once the executable file is downloaded, double-click it to run the application.

3. **Enter Initial Parameters:**
   - You'll see the application window with fields for "Initial Velocity (m/s)" and "Launch Angle (degrees)."
   - Enter the desired initial velocity and launch angle.

4. **Set Graph Limits:**
   - You can adjust the X and Y limits for the graph using the sliders.
   - Set the desired limits for the graph.

5. **Update the Plot:**
   - Click the "Update Plot" button to visualize the projectile motion.

### Using the Python Version:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   - If you haven't already, you can clone the GitHub repository to your local machine using Git:

     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/georgeh1ll/projectile-motion-simulator.git

     pip install tkinter matplotlib numpy
     ```

3. **Run the Python Script:**

   - Navigate to the repository directory on your local machine:

     ```bash
     cd Projectile-Motion-Simulator
     ```

   - Run the Python script `Projectile Motion Simulator.py`:

     ```bash
     python3 Projectile Motion Simulator.py
     ```

4. **Enter Initial Parameters:**

   - The application window will open with fields for "Initial Velocity (m/s)" and "Launch Angle (degrees)."
   - Enter the desired initial velocity and launch angle.

5. **Set Graph Limits:**

   - You can adjust the X and Y limits for the graph using the sliders.
   - Set the desired limits for the graph.

6. **Update the Plot:**
